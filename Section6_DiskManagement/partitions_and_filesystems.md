# Partitions and File Systems

- `lsblk` shows disk and partition info with mount points.
- `fdisk -l` lists partition tables but requires `sudo`.
- UUIDs under `/dev/disk/by-uuid/` uniquely identify filesystems.
- Disks are partitioned to organize storage and file systems are applied to partitions.
